Inventory Management System
Welcome to the Inventory Management System! This application is designed to help businesses manage their inventory efficiently. The system provides a user-friendly interface to track products, manage stock levels, and generate reports. The backend is built using Java Spring Boot, and the frontend is developed with Angular.

Features
Backend (Java Spring Boot)

Database Integration: Uses MySQL/PostgreSQL for data storage.

Spring Data JPA: Simplifies database interactions and reduces boilerplate code.

Spring Security: Ensures secure access to the application with JWT-based authentication.

Swagger API Documentation: Automatically generates API documentation for easy testing and integration.

Exception Handling: Custom exception handling for better error management.

Logging: Integrated logging for debugging and monitoring.

Frontend (Angular)
Responsive UI: Built with Angular Material for a clean and modern design.

Component-Based Architecture: Modular and reusable components for better maintainability.

Routing: Seamless navigation between different views (e.g., product list, add product, reports).

Forms: Reactive forms for adding and editing inventory items.

HTTP Client: Communicates with the backend API to fetch and update data.

Authentication: Login and registration pages with JWT token management.

Pagination and Sorting: Enhanced user experience for large datasets.
